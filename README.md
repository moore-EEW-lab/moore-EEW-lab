- This is the GITHUB page for the Evolution & Eco-Physiology of Wetlands (EEW) lab group at the University of Colorado Denver. http://www.moore-evo-eco.weebly.com
  
- We study how physiology shapes and constrains the directions, rates, and outcomes of evolution. We are especially interested in using this information to understand how these processes determine responses to global change.  We mainly use wetland animals in our studies.
